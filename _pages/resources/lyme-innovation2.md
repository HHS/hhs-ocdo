# Lyme Innovation

The HHS Lyme Innovation initiative is a patient-centered, data-driven approach to the serious threat of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. A recently released estimate based on insurance records suggests that each year approximately [476,000 Americans are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html). The geographic habitat range of ticks that can transmit pathogens and cause Lyme disease has also [expanded within the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/pdf/Brochure_National_Framework_VBDs-P.pdf). So is the geographic spread of the disease, which accounts for more than 70% of all vector-borne illnesses in our country. Lyme and other tick-borne conditions cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars annually.

## Purpose

HHS's Lyme Innovation initiative sees patients as more than the targets for new prevention, diagnostic, and treatment tools and techniques to address Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. Patients are the driving forces of innovation, and their lived experience is our roadmap.

Lyme Innovation uses strategic public-private partnerships to accelerate patient-centered advancements in how we address Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. By supporting interdisciplinary collaborations that reflect the initiative's core values, Lyme Innovation will:

- Build commitment to data-driven, patient-centered innovations that improve outcomes.
- Identify ways to better collect and share data while raising awareness of tick-borne illnesses.
- Accelerate discovery of next-gen diagnostic tools and technologies.
- Lower barriers across all phases of development, testing, and implementation.
