# COVID-19 Data-Driven Innovation

Social Determinants of Health (SdoH) tackles the longest standing and costliest problems in health. We use data-driven and innovation methods to address root causes of health disparities and identify systemic discrimination and poverty related to health population. 

The Drivers of Inequity strategy is focused on achieving health equity by directly tackling the root causes of health disparities by addressing major underlying factors: systemic discrimination and poverty.

- Medical disparities refer to genetic predispositions, clinical diagnoses, and direct care concerns of an individual or population. 
- Health related social needs focus on social and economic factors, including insurance coverage, transportation and similar factors that affect healthcare delivery.
- Interpersonal health factors refer to the social and interpersonal aspects of an individual or groupsâ€™ lives that impact health status.
- Structural determinants of health focus on the economic and environmental factors that impact health and health behaviors.

We harness the power of data to address inequity because data represents the foundation for advancement in meaningful root cause solutions to the Drivers of Equity. We deploy resources to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans. Financing and funding must be directed towards the actual root causes of disparities to sustainably attain equity. We also create a culture of collaboration to share successes. Collaboration and sharing risk and success will engender buy-in that prevents leaving anyone behind.

Achieving equity comes with an end-to-end consideration of ethics and responsibility. For data and solutions, equity will mean balancing privacy and transparency in a way that puts people first. Ultimately, our goal is to rebuild and repair mistrust in the communities that have been most marginalized.
