# LymeX and LymeX Accelerator
[Follow us on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/Lyme_X)

## Purpose
The Lyme Innovation initiative sees patients as more than the targets for new prevention, diagnostic, and treatment tools and techniques to address Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. Patients are the driving forces of innovation, and their lived experience is our roadmap.
Lyme Innovation uses strategic public-private partnerships to accelerate patient-centered advancements in how we address Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. By supporting interdisciplinary collaborations that reflect the initiativeâ€™s core values, Lyme Innovation will:
- Build commitment to data-driven, patient-centered innovations that improve outcomes.
- Identify ways to better collect and share data while raising awareness of tick-borne illnesses.
- Accelerate discovery of next-gen diagnostic tools and technologies.
- Lower barriers across all phases of development, testing, and implementation.

## LymeX
HHS launched the LymeX Innovation Accelerator (LymeX), an innovation partnership with the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation. LymeX is modeled after the success and methods of the KidneyX Innovation Accelerator, a partnership between HHS and the American Society of Nephrology that includes kidney-care patients in every step of its innovation process.

### Mission
LymeX will accelerate Lyme Innovation progress and strategically advance tick-borne-disease solutions in direct collaboration with Lyme patients, patient advocates, and diverse stakeholders across academia, nonprofits, industry, and government.

## Goals

### Engage Stakeholders to Facilitate Patient-Centered Innovations
By including patients and stakeholders in every step of identifying, developing, and implementing advancements in Lyme disease care, LymeX fosters innovations that can deliver transformative impact on patients' quality of life. LymeX is exploring how collaborative partnership models can best support stakeholder engagement. For example, the Health+ approach pinpoints challenges from the patient's point of view to identify and map development of new tools and technological solutions.
In close collaboration with stakeholders, LymeX aims to:
- Build capacity for effective, efficient communication among patients, stakeholders, and HHS
- Identify common challenges in patient and healthcare provider experiences
- Hold a roundtable to outline possible improvements and solutions
- Make plans for quickly developing and testing solution prototypes

### Foster Breakthroughs in Education and Awareness
LymeX supports innovative health education and public awareness initiatives that focus on tick-borne disease prevention and help clinicians, patients, and caregivers benefit from the latest scientific findings.

### Accelerate Development of Next-Gen Diagnostics
LymeX prize challenges encourage rapid, cross-sector, patient-centered diagnostic innovations. These challenges will drive creators, industries, and academia toward breakthroughs in more accurate Lyme diagnosis, helping make next-gen diagnostics available more quickly.
