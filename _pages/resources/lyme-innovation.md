# Lyme Innovation

The HHS Lyme Innovation initiative is a patient-centered, data-driven approach to the serious threat of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. A recently released estimate based on insurance records suggests that each year approximately [476,000 Americans are diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/humancases.html). The geographic habitat range of ticks that can transmit pathogens and cause Lyme disease has also [expanded within the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dvbd/pdf/Brochure_National_Framework_VBDs-P.pdf). So is the geographic spread of the disease, which accounts for more than 70% of all vector-borne illnesses in our country. Lyme and other tick-borne conditions cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars annually.

Technology efforts to address the multifaceted aspects of Lyme disease began to pick up steam in 2015, when patients, entrepreneurs, non-profit leaders, and academics organized a series of Lyme Innovation hackathons and events. These bottom-up efforts created new momentum while welcoming all stakeholders Patients and practitioners worked side-by-side to accelerate innovation in Lyme disease diagnostics, treatment, and information sharing across top-tier universities using open data, open science, open innovation, and open source code.

Meanwhile, within federal government, the 21st Century Cures Act authorized HHS to establish a [Tick-Borne Disease Working Group](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/advisory-committees/tickbornedisease/index.html) in 2017 (TBDWG). For the first time, the TBDWG brought together federal and public members to review government efforts and scientific research in order to make shared recommendations on how to advance the field. The TBDWG produced its [first report with 28 recommendations to the U.S. Congress and HHS Secretary in 2018. - PDF](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/tbdwg-report-to-congress-2018.pdf)

<i><b>"I want you to know that we, at HHS, hear you. We, at HHS, are listening to your input. We, at HHS, are responding and making Lyme and other tick-borne diseases a priority."—</b> HHS Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan</i>

In response to the 2018 TBDWG report, HHS launched its Lyme Innovation initiative to help connect the bottom-up community needs and momentum with top-down, federal priorities and resources. Transformative change happens when the bottom-up and top-down meet, as this ensures that federal efforts address real-world needs that matter to Americans and their communities. HHS Lyme Innovation became a confluence for all sectors and stakeholders to come together; it became a tool for participating in, boosting, and supporting patient-centered, data-driven approaches to Lyme disease. The HHS Lyme Innovation initiative augments and amplifies the early momentum of community-based innovation efforts by leveraging federal resources and reach—while seeing patients and citizens as driving forces of practical innovation.
