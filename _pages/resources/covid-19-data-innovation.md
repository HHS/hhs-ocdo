# COVID-19 Data-Driven Innovation

<i>Note: Please visit the [CDC’s website on COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the most up-to-date information and COVID-19 guidance.</i>

COVID-19 data-driven innovation uses novel methods and collaboration to accelerate scientific and public health insights to ultimately shorten the time it takes for COVID-19 information and solutions to save lives. This HHS initiative is co-led by the [Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/index.html) and the Office of the Chief Data Officer. Collaboratively, we are creating crosscutting impact and real-world value from a data-driven ecosystem during one of the most challenging public health crises of our lifetimes. By opening COVID-19 datasets on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) and applying proven innovation methods like [Health+ (“health plus”)](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/digital-services/health-plus/index.html), our COVID-19 innovation success will be measured by patient outcomes, social equity, economic recovery, and how HHS improves the lives of all Americans touched by the novel coronavirus.
