# KidneyX

[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kidney_X)!

The Kidney Innovation Accelerator (KidneyX) is a public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the American Society of Nephrology (ASN) to accelerate innovation in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases.

## Purpose

An estimated 850 million people worldwide are living with kidney disease. [KidneyX](https://www.kidneyx.org/) seeks to improve their lives by accelerating the development of drugs, devices, biologics, and other therapies across the spectrum of kidney care. KidneyX will 'de-risk' innovation by streamlining processes, reducing regulatory barriers, and modernizing the way everyone pays for treatment. By inviting innovation from outside the government, KidneyX will stimulate and accelerate innovation through a series of cash prize competitions.

### The KidneyX Approach

Building off the success of similar public-private accelerators, KidneyX is engaging a community of researchers, innovators, and investors to bring breakthrough therapies to patients through:

#### Development

Driving patient access to disruptive technologies via competitive, merit-based prize funding for innovators.

#### Coordination

Providing a clearer and less expensive path for bringing products to patients and their families.

#### Urgency

Creating a sense of urgency by spotlighting the immediate needs of patients and their families.

## Previous Prize Competitions

### Redesign Dialysis Phase 2

Redesign Dialysis Phase 2 challenged participants to build and test prototype solutions, or components of solutions, that could replicate normal kidney functions or improve dialysis access. Phase 2 received 70 submissions from experts across bioengineering, biotechnology, medical devices, nephrology, and more. The six winners each received $500,000.

### Redesign Dialysis Phase 1

Redesign Dialysis Phase 1 invited participants to submit proposals on approaches that could enable the design of new artificial kidney devices, extending life and improving quality of life. This first phase received 165 submissions that ranged from innovations in vascular access and fluid filtration to innovations in hemodialysis and biosensors. The 15 Phase 1 winners each received $75,000.

### Patient Innovator Challenge

The Patient Innovator Challenge, funded by the National Kidney Foundation, challenged individuals, communities, businesses, institutions, and nonprofit organizations to submit ideas for improving therapeutic options and quality of life for people living with kidney disease. The competition sought ideas and solutions that people living with kidney disease have developed through their own everyday experiences and ingenuity. The 25 winners shared a total prize pool of $70,000.

## Artificial Kidney Prize

The [Artificial Kidney Prize](https://akp.kidneyx.org/?utm_source=HHS&utm_medium=web-content&utm_campaign=launch) is a competition to accelerate the development of artificial kidneys toward human clinical trials. Phases 1 and 2 will award up to $10 million in prizes.

The Artificial Kidney Prize builds on [past KidneyX competitions](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/kidneyx/previous-prize-competitions/index.html?language=en) but is distinct in its goal: to accelerate the development of continuous kidney replacement therapies that provide transformational treatment options beyond current dialysis methods. Artificial kidneys may be wearable, implantable, bioengineered, developed as a xenotransplant or chimera organ, or other approaches not yet conceived.

### Looking ahead to Phase 2

Phase 2 of the Artificial Kidney Prize will be open to eligible entrants from Phase 1, as well as new eligible entrants who did not enter the first phase. The second phase will focus on initial integration of prototype solutions into an artificial kidney, or advancement of already integrated prototype solutions. Phase 2 is expected to launch in fall 2021.

At the discretion of HHS and ASN, additional competition phases may follow Phase 2 to further accelerate development of artificial kidneys. KidneyX hopes to secure a total of $200 million to support all phases.

## COVID-19 Kidney Care Challenge

The $300,000 [KidneyX COVID-19 Kidney Care Challenge](https://www.kidneyx.org/PrizeCompetitions/covid19kidneycarechallenge?utm_source=HHS&utm_medium=web-content&utm_campaign=launch) seeks solutions that reduce the transmission of the coronavirus among people living with kidney disease and/or reduce the risk of kidney damage among people who contract the virus. Winners will receive $20,000 each in recognition of their solutions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for the estimated 37 million Americans living with kidney disease â€” as well as their caregivers and healthcare practitioners. Patients, caregivers, frontline staff, and organizations have quickly responded by developing or adapting solutions for safely delivering kidney care during the pandemic. The COVID-19 Kidney Care Challenge aims to identify and share the best of these solutions so that other patients, caregivers, and staff can benefit from them.
