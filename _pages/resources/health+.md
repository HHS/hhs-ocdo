# Health+

The healthcare space innovates slowly. It is failing to meet the ever-increasing need for improved care.

How can HHS leverage its institutional knowledge and position to bring leaders and patients together and improve the healthcare space?

Meet Health+.

Health+ (“health plus”) is an ongoing series of research and healthathon cycles sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services InnovationX team. It is focused on specific, high-impact health issues, with the goal of fostering technology solutions and creative problem solving.

## Design, Discovery & Definition

We will conduct landscape research focused on developing deep understanding of the challenge, the audience, and the vision set forth by executive stakeholders and intra-agency partnerships. By utilizing Human Centered Design (HCD) methods, conducting problem validation with stakeholders, identifying salient user stories, and forming of personas and journey maps, we can inform the round table vision and suggest solutions for those affected by critical health issues. Together, we will work hand-in-hand to execute a roundtable with identified stakeholders, match emerging themes to data sets, and prepare artifacts necessary so that a product team is able to execute different strategies during the rapid prototyping phase.

## Rapid Prototyping

This phase includes engaging with patients, subject matter experts, and policy makers in a healthathon, in which participants prototype creative solutions for specific audiences, problems, and opportunities identified by the roundtable. Healthathon outputs may include policy initiatives, technical products, white papers, and more.

## Transition

Armed with newly formed prototypes and solutions that positively affect the lives of people living with identified health issues, we work closely with our partners so the team is prepared to continue momentum forward.
