# Open Data

HHS publishes datasets as part of its Open Data program. The primary resource for public access is healthdata.gov, but additional sites are published for specialized topics.

## Open Data Inventories and APIs

[Healthdata.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) is dedicated to making data discoverable and making valuable government data available to the public in the hopes of better health outcomes for all.
[HHS Product Public Data Hub](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/) provides high-quality, accessible, and timely information for entrepreneurs, researchers, and policy makers to help drive insights and better health outcomes for all.
- [Open FDA](https://open.fda.gov/) is a web-based API for querying data from FDA reporting systems, for example the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). The API is divided into 5 data systems (18 total data assets): Animal and Veterinary, Food, Human Drug, Medical Device, and Other. Data sets are also downloadable and are derived from FDA reporting systems. The source code for the API is open access.
- [Data.CDC.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/) catalogs numerous types of data covering 21 categories, including: smoking and tobacco use, injury and violence, and disability and health. Data are publicly available.


## Data Repositories and Search Tools

- The [Health Services and Sciences Research Resources database](https://hsrr.nlm.nih.gov/) is designed for health care researchers and health sciences librarians. It provides information about research datasets and instruments/indices employed in Health Services Research, Behavioral and Social Sciences and Public Health. The database does not contain actual resources but does include links to PubMed and URLs with additional information.
- The [NIH Data Sharing Repositories](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_repositories.html) is a list of repositories containing biomedical data from NIH-funded and other scientific research. It is maintained by the BioMedical Informatics Coordinating Committee The inventory contains 82 data repositories, most of which are public use. The data contained within the repositories is intended for use by researchers, and many of the repositories allow for open submission by NIH-funded and other researchers.
- The [CMS Data Navigator](https://dnav.cms.gov/) is an interactive search tool for CMS data assets including reports, publications, interactive tools, fact sheets, and other types of data. The user can search for data assets by program, setting/type of care, geography or document type. The data navigator comprises 430 data assets. The audience for the inventory is not explicitly described.
- The [National Center for Health Statistics website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm) provides access to surveys and data collection systems collected and maintained by NCHS, the principal federal statistics agency for health. These include population surveys, provider surveys, historical surveys, and vital statistics data. The intended audience is public health and health policy researchers and practitioners.
- A [Portal to Medicare](https://data.medicare.gov/) is maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to compare data for hospitals, nursing homes, physicians, home health care, dialysis facility, hospice, rehabilitation facility, long-term care, and suppliers. The datasets are pulled from the Medicare.gov's Compare Websites and Directories.
- The [Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/) consists of health care databases and related software tools and products developed through Federal-State-Industry partnerships and sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Example of data found in this database are encounter-level health care data, longitudinal hospital care data (dating to 1988), health policy issues, cost/quality of health services, medical practice patterns, and accessibility to health care programs. The intended audience is health services researchers and decision makers.
- The [National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect (NDACAN)](https://www.ndacan.acf.hhs.gov/datasets/datasets-list.cfm) is an inventory of datasets obtained from researchers and data collection efforts in the field of child abuse an neglect. The inventory is housed at Cornell University and datasets may be requested by researchers.
- The [Research Data Assistance Center](https://www.resdac.org/) provides free assistance to researchers interested in the CMS data. As a CMS contractor, ResDAC provides assistance to academic, non-profit, for-profit and government researchers.
- The [DCCPS Public Datasets & Analyses](https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/cr-dataset.html) inventory is a directory of data sources about cancer research and epidemiology, cancer survival, health services, and behavioral sciences. The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences created this data resource for the public and research community.
- [DASH](https://dash.nichd.nih.gov/) is a centralized resource for researchers to store de-identified data and to access data and associated biospecimens from NICHD supported studies for use in secondary research. The intended audience is researchers.
- [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/) (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research) is an online query system that provides access to a wide range of CDC resources and data systems. The intended audience is public health practitioners and decision makers.
- The [HRSA warehouse](https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/data-explorer) holds maps, dashboards, and query tools that outline HRSA's programs. The website provides access to data for HRSA grantees, clinicians, and health researchers and practitioners.
