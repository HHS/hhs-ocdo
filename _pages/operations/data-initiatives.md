# OCDO Initiatives TEST

OCDO is following the direction set in the [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/), which includes advancements in two key areas.

## Data Maturity

HHS OCDO is following the [CMMI Data Management Maturity Model](https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity), an industry standard, to serve as the foundation for building and enhancing the Department’s data management capabilities.

## Data Skills

Data analysis and literacy skills are critical as HHS continues its transition to data driven decision making. Per the 2020 action plan, HHS is reviewing the needs of the Operating Divisions and OCDO is designing services that can be consumed across HHS. This includes the [Data Science CoLab](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/data-science-colab/index.html) program to build a community of data scientists at HHS.
