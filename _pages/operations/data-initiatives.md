# OCDO Initiatives

OCDO is following the direction set in the [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/), which includes advancements in two key areas.

OCDO is fulfilling the legal obligations of Title II, Section 3520. Functions include:
  - Be responsible for lifecycle data management.
  - Ensure all data needs of the Department are met.
  - Manage data assets of the Department.
  - Encourage collaborative approaches on improving data use.
  - Improve infrastructure to reduce barriers that inhibit data asset accessibility. 

OCDO’s work addresses the HHS Information Technology Strategic Plan Goal #3: Enhance Data and Interoperability. Establish data as a strategic asset by developing data and interoperability policies, ethics, strategies, and standards that default to sharing and discovery in order to increase data-driven innovation across HHS.
  - 3.1 Standardize data sharing.
  - 3.2 Create data policies.
  - 3.3 Cultivate data sharing culture.
  - 3.4 Increase data insights.

## Data Maturity

HHS OCDO is following the [CMMI Data Management Maturity Model](https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity), an industry standard, to serve as the foundation for building and enhancing the Department’s data management capabilities.

## Data Skills

Data analysis and literacy skills are critical as HHS continues its transition to data driven decision making. Per the 2020 action plan, HHS is reviewing the needs of the Operating Divisions and OCDO is designing services that can be consumed across HHS. This includes the [Data Science CoLab](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/data-science-colab/index.html) program to build a community of data scientists at HHS.
