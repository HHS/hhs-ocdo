# Innovation "Tours of Duty"

OCDO Data Governance is focused on how decisions are made about data at the Department level and across the HHS divisions, and how people and processes are expected to act in relation to its data assets, and ultimately creating a culture of shared responsibility for the value of its data assets.  

## Serve as an EIR

HHS OCDO has a leading role in ensuring HHS complies with Department and Federal policies and mandated objectives. [HHS OCIO Policies](https://www.hhs.gov/web/governance/digital-strategy/it-policy-archive/index.html) are the primary tool for achieving this task and will be developed and reviewed through the Data Governance Board. 

A principal outside driver for policies is the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/) goal of [Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/), and the [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) to meet the changing role of data and needs of democracy. The strategy seeks to better enable data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidential.
