#### Who Can Be An Entrepreneur-in-Residence?

Anyone except current federal employees may apply to be an EIR.

#### What Characteristics Do We Look For In An EIR?

As with most questions in life: it depends! In this case, it varies depending on the needs of the project. But all of the projects need creative and talented problem solvers with a can-do attitude – an entrepreneurial spirit.

Typically, EIRs are mid- to senior-level professionals. EIRs may be academics, technology entrepreneurs, software designers, policymakers, business gurus, or non-profit leaders who have led innovative achievements in their field. Every project requires different skillsets but across all projects, EIRs resonate with these three sentences:

- The word “risk” does not scare me. You have lots of experience taking risks for a new product or solution.
- I know open innovation techniques like the back of my hand. You enjoy leveraging, discussing, and meditating on things like agile development, human-centered design, lean methodologies, and/or iterative program design. (You might even think about them on rainy days or on long car rides.)
- I love working on teams. You enjoy working with people with different professional backgrounds and can move cross-functional teams towards a common goal.

#### What Does the Recruitment Process Look Like?

This is what our recruitment process looks like if you were to apply:

Step 1 – A project is selected and we post the opportunity/call for entrepreneurs.

Step 2 – [INSERT YOUR NAME] submits an awesome application for review. This consists of submitting a resume and answering one short answer question.

Step 3 – We do our internal thing (see Step 4) and typically get back to candidates within 30 days.

Step 4 – After an internal shortlisting of qualified candidates, the HHS staff who are working on the project team will interview candidates and make the final EIR selection.

### Some challenges need outside help

We don’t always have all the answers.

The HHS Entrepreneurs-in-Residence program enables:

- Access to a pool of unique skill sets difficult to identify in government
- Project support and visibility from the highest levels of HHS leadership
- Access to a network of internal and external innovators affiliated with HHS IDEA Lab programs
- Support and freedom to incorporate new approaches to reduce time, lower cost and improve customer satisfaction for your program/process
- A suite of tools typically not available to staff including a secure cloud environment for app development and testing as well as GitHub access
- Assistance with the hiring and on-boarding process for the EIR

### Who can submit a project idea?

Any HHS employee, or team of HHS employees, who want to test new methodologies to solve problems can submit a project idea.

We do ask that each team designates a Project Lead and that she or he be able to dedicate approximately 25% of her or his time to the project. She or he should also be prepared to continue project implementation following the departure of the Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) if the pilot is deemed successful or otherwise document the lessons learned.

### How do I submit a project idea?

Before you jump into the submission, we ask that you and your team reach out to us to have a brief conversation about your project. We will work together to decide if an EIR would be a good fit for the program.

### What projects do we support?

Any idea or identified problem can be the subject of a project. But alas, we do have a limited number of projects that we can support during the year.

Projects that are a good fit for the HHS EIR Program typically have the following characteristics:

- High priority for the participating office, HHS Operating Division, or Staff Division with the potential to affect major change within the organization
- Ability to be implemented in about a year
- Can uniquely benefit from input from entrepreneurial talent, and/or expertise in areas such as open innovation, agile development or lean startup
- Strong support from leadership within the HHS Operating / Staff Division
- Participation of outstanding employees from within HHS Operating / Staff Division
- Committed funding from the HHS Operating / Staff Division to support the EIR (salary and project expenses) and project implementation

Please describe and estimate the resources and budget needed to complete the project (please assume that the EIR will be paid at the same level as internal project team members and consider possible travel costs for the EIR).

## FAQs

### We Also Work With Non-Profits to Bring New Ideas And Expertise Into The Department

Not-for-profit organizations can sponsor a paid fellowship to be filled by an individual with a background in entrepreneurship and innovation. These “Innovators-in-Residence” leverage the resources and expertise of both organizations (HHS and the sponsoring organization) during their appointment, to tackle specific challenges in health and the delivery of human services.

The IDEA Lab works with the Innovator-In-Residence and his or her supervisor (the sponsor), and designated HHS mentors to develop a project concept and establish project goals that are mutually agreed upon between HHS and the sponsor.

Innovators-in-Residence are employees of the sponsor organization and participate in government activities through the Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA). The IPA enables the exchange of talent between government and organizations for a wide array of practices. If an organization has not previously participated in an IPA employee exchange with HHS, an application is submitted and reviewed for approval before the project is started.
If your organization is interested in becoming a sponsoring organization or has additional questions regarding eligibility, please email idealab@hhs.gov.

### Frequently Asked Questions

How are Entrepreneurs-in-Residence compensated?

  - Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB);
  - Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLI);
  - Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS); and
  - Annual and sick leave.

Do Entrepreneurs-in-Residence have to relocate?

- In order to maximize the effectiveness of the project, we recommend that Entrepreneurs-in-Residence relocate to the project site for the duration of the program. Relocation costs for EIRs have not been covered in the past.

Does the HHS IDEA Lab provide funding to support the Entrepreneurs-in-Residence?

- No, the participating Operating or Staff Division must provide funding for the EIR salary, any anticipated travel, and project costs. HHS provides:
  - Access to an external talent pool of individuals who do not normally apply for government positions
  - Support and visibility of your project at the highest levels of HHS leadership to test your idea and remove barriers
  - Access to a network of internal and external innovators, including current and former participants in the HHS Entrepreneurs-in-Residence, HHS Innovator-in-Residence and HHS Ignite programs

How are federal employees, or Internal Entrepreneurs, compensated?

- Internal Entrepreneurs will continue to be paid under the same compensation structure prior to joining the HHS EIR Program.

For federal employees, what approvals (if any) do I need to apply?

- In addition to identifying the project lead and project participants, each team needs to identify an Executive Sponsor for the project, who is typically at the Division Director, Bureau Chief, or Executive Officer level.
