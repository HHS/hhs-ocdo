# Governance

OCDO Data Governance is focused on how decisions are made about data at the Department level and across the HHS divisions, and how people and processes are expected to act in relation to its data assets, and ultimately creating a culture of shared responsibility for the value of its data assets.  

## Policies

HHS OCDO has a leading role in ensuring HHS complies with Department and Federal policies and mandated objectives. [HHS OCIO Policies](https://www.hhs.gov/web/governance/digital-strategy/it-policy-archive/index.html) are the primary tool for achieving this task and will be developed and reviewed through the Data Governance Board. 

A principal outside driver for policies is the [President’s Management Agenda](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/management/pma/) goal of [Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/), and the [Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/) to meet the changing role of data and needs of democracy. The strategy seeks to better enable data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidential.

## Standards

Standards for enterprise adoption are endorsed by the Data Governance Board.  These standards are intended to optimize data discovery and sharing, including an alignment to the Federal Data Strategy’s metadata standard.

## Oversight

The HHS Data Governance Board (DGB) was formed to serve as a collaborative body of Department representatives to coordinate or inspire improvements to data management capabilities. The CDO Perryn Ashmore is the chair of the DGB, with Deputy CDO Kevin Duvall presiding over monthly meetings. Members represent each operating division.
