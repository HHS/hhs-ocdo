# Innovation

In support of the HHS mission to enhance the health and well-being of all Americans, OCDO shares open data that fuels innovation. Thousands of HHS datasets for public use on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov) can be used by anyone to accelerate scientific discoveries, power new business models, and fuel innovative solutions.  Often, these solutions arise by connecting diverse groups or forming partnerships to span disciplinary silos and co-create new digital tools powered by HHS open data. 

HHS OCDO curated resources into an Innovation Toolkit, which aims to be a living repository for open innovation at the department. Open innovation includes crowdsourcing, citizen science, challenges, prizes, partnerships, human-centered design, agile methods, and sprints fueled by open data. This toolkit showcases interagency innovation resources and shared services, specifically software with HHS authorization to operate (ATO), to drive open innovation across the department.
