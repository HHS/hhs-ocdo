## Core Values

Empower People with "Yes, And!"

### Deliberative and Pre-Decisional Communication
- Ethical use of data at original collection and future reuse demonstrates institutional integrity and endears trust in the decisions the data informs.

### Apply Knowledge to Get Results
- We are transparent about what we collect, why we collect it, how we collect it, and what we do with it. We request feedback from the broadest base of stakeholders. We aim to increase trust in the data, processes, and organization.

### Prioritize Impact
- Trust in government depends on high quality of data and integrity of governance. We set policies and standards to guide the organization to apply consistent quality assurance for reliable decisions.

### Create Opportunities
- Use collaboration within the agency and through engagement with partners and the public because we are greater together than apart.

### Default to Transparency
- We embrace transparency and user-centered methods to co-create solutions with all stakeholders who—no matter their background and training—are respected and valued as partners. With open minds and humility, we listen.

### Listen to the People We Serve
-  We have a bias toward action and strive to be the catalyst to deliver more value, faster, throughout the organization.
