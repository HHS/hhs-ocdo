# Crowdsourcing & Citizen Science

Agencies are required to report on CCS activities conducted during the reporting period that were authorized using the Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act. Citizen science—a form of open collaboration in which individuals or organizations participate voluntarily in the scientific process in various ways. Crowdsourcing—a method to obtain needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting voluntary contributions from a group of individuals or organizations, especially from an online community. Agencies are highly encouraged to also report on CCS activities conducted under other authorities. Only those CCS activities that the agency oversaw should be included. DO NOT include CCS supported as grants for activities proposed by grant awardees. The final consolidated report on Federal Prizes and Challenges, and Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science will be submitted to Congress and made publicly available.

The Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Act (15 U.S.C. 3724) requires all crowdsourcing and citizen science (CCS) projects carried out under this authority be reported as a component of the biennial reporting requirement for Federal Prizes and Challenges. OSTP is required to submit the biennial report on CCS activities to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives. This is the opportunity for agencies to highlight activities to OSTP and Congress. Information is valuable to the Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science Community of Practice.
