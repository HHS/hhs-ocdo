# About Us

The InnovationX team harnesses the power of collaboration, data-driven innovation, human-centered design through our Health+ methodology, and vector-borne diseases such as Lyme. Our work brings together scientists, public health experts, technologists, and designers to leverage emerging technologies to drive better, more equitable health outcomes across America.

We are a team of innovators within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH). Our work goes beyond the OASH and can be applied to many parts of HHS. 

If you are interested in working with us or learning more about what we do, contact us at idealab@hhs.gov.
