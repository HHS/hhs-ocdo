# COVID-19 Data-Driven Innovation

<i>Note: Please visit the [CDC’s website on COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the most up-to-date information and COVID-19 guidance.</i>

COVID-19 data-driven innovation uses novel methods and collaboration to accelerate scientific and public health insights to ultimately shorten the time it takes for COVID-19 information and solutions to save lives. This HHS initiative is co-led by the [Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health](https://www.hhs.gov/ash/index.html) and the Office of the Chief Data Officer. Collaboratively, we are creating crosscutting impact and real-world value from a data-driven ecosystem during one of the most challenging public health crises of our lifetimes. By opening COVID-19 datasets on [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/) and applying proven innovation methods like [Health+ (“health plus”)](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/digital-services/health-plus/index.html), our COVID-19 innovation success will be measured by patient outcomes, social equity, economic recovery, and how HHS improves the lives of all Americans touched by the novel coronavirus. 

COVID-19 is a multi-faceted challenge and we are employing numerous innovative practices to address the crisis. Over [200 COVID-19 datasets](https://healthdata.gov/search/og_group_ref/286/type/dataset?query=covid-19&sort_by=changed&sort_order=DESC) on HealthData.gov serve as the fuel for much of our HHS innovation, including the:

1.	<b>COVID-19 At-Anywhere Diagnostics “Design-a thon”</b> - A virtual innovation sprint with 750 problem solvers who produced over 30 capstone projects and [16 winning Design-a-thon teams](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/16/winners-of-hhs-design-a-thon-to-develop-innovative-digital-health-tools-for-covid-19.html) to capture COVID-19 diagnostic data and report key elements to inform a data-driven pandemic response.

2.	<b>COVID-19 TOPx Technology Sprint</b> – A fast-paced, two-month build cycle using the “TOPx Toolkit” created by the U.S. Census Bureau with 14 industry-led teams to further develop COVID-19 diagnostic reporting tools and accelerate the public use of these tools, making it easier for individuals and organizations to safely report positive/negative test results.

3.	<b>COVID-19 Open Data Roundtables</b> – Hands on, structured workshops that improve accessibility and data sharing for public health and the public good, bringing together community, state and federal government leaders, the private sector, non-profits, research, and academia.

These innovation methods succeed because of participation from diverse stakeholders across multiple sectors: industry, academia, non-profit organizations, all levels of government, and individual entrepreneurs and problem solvers. Together, through COVID-19 data-driven innovation, we are saving and improving American lives.

## COVID-19 TOPx Sprint

<i>Note: Please visit the [CDC’s website on COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the most up-to-date information and COVID-19 guidance.</i>

The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly changed the way we live. Data and data standards are essential for an effective U.S. response, but only if data are used and standards are widely adopted by all sectors. With COVID-19 TOPx, HHS is collaborating with industry-led teams to transform HHS open data and data standards into digital tools with practical real-world applications. 

### What is The Opportunity Project (TOP)?

- [The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov/) is a collaboration process developed by the White House in 2016 to speed up innovation fueled by government open data. Since then, the U.S. Census Bureau has scaled the program to different government agencies, working with thousands of participants to create over 100 digital products. TOP is a proven innovation model, typically a 12- to 14-week technology sprint with industry, which government can leverage alongside open data to catalyze new technologies. 
- Iterate with user-centered, agile build cycles.
- Launch a new digital tool (or build new functionality for an existing tool).

Each year, the U.S. Census Bureau hosts the annual [TOP Demo Day](https://opportunity.census.gov/our-process/) to showcase digital tools developed through TOP sprints. At Demo Day, the press, data enthusiasts, technologists, government leaders, and others gather to celebrate the launch of products built that year.

### What is a TOPx Sprint?

In late 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau published its [TOPx Toolkit](https://opportunity.census.gov/topx-toolkit/introduction/) with how-to instructions for agencies to run their own TOP-like sprints, called “TOPx” sprints. They bring together technologists, government, and communities to rapidly prototype digital products—powered by [U.S. open data](https://www.data.gov/)—that solve real-world problems. The TOPx model gives federal agencies a framework for collaborating with industry and non-government organizations using government open data to:

- Address mission-critical priorities with data and technology innovation
- Recruit cross-sector participants and strengthen collaborative networks
- Facilitate a virtual technology development sprint on a flexible and modifiable timeline
- Showcase outcomes and new digital tools at TOP or TOPx Demo Days

### HHS InnovationX Pioneers the First-Ever COVID-19 TOPx Sprint

Innovation necessitates trying new things, and the InnovationX team has introduced HHS to TOP and TOPx sprints. The first-ever HHS TOPx sprint, launched in January 2021, focused on COVID-19. Fourteen industry-led teams participated in this COVID-19 TOPx sprint with the goal to develop digital health tools to capture, harmonize, and securely transmit key data elements from at-anywhere COVID-19 diagnostic tests. Participating TOPx teams won the [COVID-19 At-Anywhere Diagnostics Design-a-thon](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-at-anywhere-diagnostics-design-a-thon/index.html) (innovation sprint) with HHS in late 2020.

This first [COVID-19 TOPx sprint](https://waters.crowdicity.com/) used a condensed 8-week build cycle, compared to the usual 12- to 14-week TOP length. This abbreviated timeline reflects the urgency of today’s COVID-19 pandemic — people need COVID-19 solutions now. 

The COVID-19 TOPx sprint occurred in the open with all meetings and demos open to the public through waters.crowdicity.com, a crowdsourcing platform for interactive ideas exchange. This made the COVID-19 TOPx process visible, transparent, and accessible to all.  

During the TOPx sprint, HHS policy experts and data stewards provide feedback to the participating teams led by industry, academia, and non-government organizations. As with TOP sprints, all TOPx sprints must use government open data and agile methods to ship tangible, real-world digital tools by the end of the collaboration.  Below is a typical process and timeline: 

- Develop TOPx problem statement(s) and identify relevant open datasets
- Recruit sprint participants 
- Facilitate an 8- to 14-week technology development sprint 
  - Organize and facilitate milestone calls (User Research, Data Discovery, Alpha Demo, Beta Demo, Final Demo)
  - Provide insight related to the agency’s policy and operational areas
  - Answer questions about finding and using the agency’s public data
  - Provide feedback on the products being developed
- Host an (optional) in-person event during which products are launched and showcased
- Participate in the annual TOP Demo Day, hosted by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The InnovationX team is currently developing the HHS TOPx Toolkit, including HHS case studies and how-to methods using [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov/). This will provide innovation support and an HHS-specific playbook for the 80,000+ HHS employees across 11 Operating Divisions and over 15 Staff Divisions that may wish to use TOP or TOPx methods to advance their priorities and mission.

## COVID-19 Diagnostics Design-a-thon

<i>Note: Please visit the [CDC’s website on COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the most up-to-date information and COVID-19 guidance.</i>

We brought together innovative private-sector tech teams and data-driven public sector leaders to address one of our most difficult problems using federal open data standards — diagnosing COVID-19 infections. 

### What is a Design-a-thon?

A public-facing, open-innovation sprint that connects industry with the U.S. government. Teams work quickly to design software that can be scaled to address a public health need.

The [COVID-19 At-Anywhere Diagnostics Design-a-thon](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/12/16/winners-of-hhs-design-a-thon-to-develop-innovative-digital-health-tools-for-covid-19.html) issued a call-to-action for American industry and the public to unleash the power of open innovation to develop digital solutions for COVID-19 data capture, harmonization, and reporting from diagnostic tests. HHS crowdsourced ideas from teams that proposed solutions through the [Waters.Crowdicity.com –](https://waters.crowdicity.com/) platform. This [“open innovation”](https://www.hhs.gov/cto/initiatives/open-innovation/about/index.html) platform enabled Design-a-thon teams to form, exchange ideas, and submit “Capstone Projects” built with HHS open data, open source code, and open science. 

### What are outcomes of the COVID-19 At-Anywhere Diagnostics Design-a-thon?

The Design-a-thon brought together software developers, designers, and engineers with in vitro diagnostic device developers and COVID-19 subject matter experts to build software and digital tools that are directly integrated with COVID-19 tests. Over 750 problem solvers and innovators participated. Collectively, participants formed Design-a-thon teams and submitted over 30 “Capstone Projects” with capabilities to alleviate data collection and reporting burdens for patients, providers, anyone administering/using tests, or labs through which data is routed. These digital capabilities included automated and semi-automated digital tools for reporting COVID-19 results from at-home, non-prescription, and over-the-counter tests on the market now. Judges invited 16 winners to participate in the TOPx tech sprint.

### What is WATERS?

During the Design-a-thon, HHS built and launched a “Wireless Automated Transmission for Electronic Reporting Systems” or WATERS to ingest data feeds from many COVID-19 apps and digital tools, including those built by TOPx teams. WATERS provides digital infrastructure for government to securely receive, harmonize, and transmit data from diagnostic device apps, Laboratory Information Management Systems and other entities sending COVID-19 diagnostic data. 

A key function of WATERS is “optionality” – the ability to support disparate, complex systems to accommodate current and changing needs. We are ensuring that hospitals, nursing homes, and other healthcare providers have the options to use apps that suit their specific needs and reporting requirements. Such optionality will alleviate data collection and reporting burdens for patients, providers, anyone administering/using tests, labs through which data is routed, since the users can continue using their preferred app(s) and tool(s) for WATERS to ingest.

## COVID-19 Open Data Roundtables

<i>Note: Please visit the [CDC’s website on COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for the most up-to-date information and COVID-19 guidance.</i>

Open Data Roundtables are unique convenings that bring together data providers and their data users to help identify high-value datasets, find action-oriented solutions to data problems, catalyze research on emerging data issues, and establish new collaborations. They connect experts from government, nonprofits and NGOs, academia, and the private sector who may never have met before but who share common goals and interests. 

### What is the history of Open Data Roundtables?

Open Data Roundtables held by the White House and numerous federal agencies have focused on topics including medical research and health care, transportation, energy and the environment, and the federal data strategy. A Roundtable can cover the use of an individual agency’s data, cross-cutting topics and issues that involve multiple agencies, or federal data policy across the government. Open Data Roundtables often involve participants from state and local governments to address how their data programs can best work together with federal programs.

Since 2018, HHS has held seven Open Data Roundtables on a wide range of topics. The HHS Office of the CTO co-hosted these Roundtables with the nonprofit Center for Open Data Enterprise (CODE), which developed the methodology for working with federal agencies to hold these events. 

### When is the next Open Data Roundtable?

HHS is now exploring a potential COVID-19 Open Data Roundtable as well as other efforts to engage stakeholders in addressing the pandemic. More information will be made available on this webpage.
